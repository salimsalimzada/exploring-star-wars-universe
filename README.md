# Exploring Star Wars

This repository contains the implementation of a technical task provided by PASHA Insurance as part of their interview process. The code is for evaluation purposes only and is **not intended for production use**.

## üöÄ Live Demo

## üñºÔ∏è Wireframe

Here's the initial wireframe I created for the **Planets** list and details pages.  
This served as a visual guide during the early stages of development:

## Features

### Pages

The application includes separate pages for each of the following resources:

- **Films**: Displays a list of Star Wars films.
- **People (Characters)**: Lists Star Wars characters and their details.
- **Starships**: Displays available starships in the Star Wars universe.
- **Vehicles**: Lists Star Wars vehicles and their specifications.
- **Species**: Shows various species in Star Wars.
- **Planets**: Displays information about different planets in the Star Wars galaxy.

### Infinite Scrolling

The application dynamically fetches and displays resources as the user scrolls down the page, improving the user experience without requiring a page reload.

### Custom UI Components

The application is designed with **custom, reusable components**, ensuring a consistent and maintainable user interface.

### Data Fetching

- Utilized **Tanstack Query** for efficient and optimized data fetching.
- Created a custom `service-fetch` utility to simplify API integration and error handling.

### Performance Optimization and Error Handling

- **Lazy Loading** for route-based components to reduce initial bundle size.
- **React Suspense** for loading fallback UIs.
- **Error Boundaries** to catch and gracefully handle component tree errors.

### üß™ Testing

- Wrote test cases for utility functions to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Code Quality

- Set up **Husky** with **lint-staged** to enforce linting and formatting rules on commits and pre-push actions:
- **ESLint Warning Block on Commit**: Blocks commits if there are any ESLint warnings.
- **Pre-Push Block on Commit**: Blocks pushes if any issues are detected during the pre-push checks.
- Configured **Prettier** and **ESLint** to ensure a consistent code style across the project.

## Screenshots

#### ESLint Warning Blocks Commit

> Commits are blocked if any linting warnings or errors are present.

#### Pre-Push Hook Blocks Push

> Code cannot be pushed unless all checks pass, ensuring consistency and reliability.

## Installation

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:salimsalimzada/exploring-star-wars-universe.git
